As stakers, we all want to minimize downtime and the risk of being slashed.
Minimizing downtime is a difficult objective to achieve since a validator might be down for various reasons: system failures, incomplete restart policies, connectivity issues, hardware maintenance or software bugs. Staking with two or more machines for redundancy naturally comes to mind.
People might say, “redundancy leads to slashing!” which is a legitimate concern because we could accidentally run multiple validators with the same validator keys at the same time.</description></item></channel></rss>
